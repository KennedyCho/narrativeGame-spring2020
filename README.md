The COVID-19 outbreak has forced many to adapt quickly under difficult circumstances; however, we believe this communal experience offers more than just pain and suffering. During difficult times we can also be sure to see the good in humanity as well as the bad. This project will depict the reality of some individuals (based on written first hand accounts) during the COVID-19 pandemic. By sharing these stories, we hope to encourage the public to develop a larger understanding of the current situation and their role within it.  

This is an interactive narrative experience that allows users to carve their own path using branching storylines.  

Our minimum viable product is a site where users can choose choice A or choice B to return different reactions. The most basic storyline consists of 3 “checkpoints” (instances where users can choose an action) with 2 options each.
